## ✅ Completed Tasks

---

### 🌸 Task 1: Iris Dataset Exploration

**🔹 Objective:**  
Explore the Iris dataset and visualize relationships between flower measurements and species.

**🔹 My Approach:**  
- Loaded the Iris dataset using Seaborn
- Inspected the dataset with `.head()`, `.shape()`, and `.describe()`
- Created visualizations:
  - Scatter plot of Petal Length vs Petal Width
  - Histogram of Sepal Length
  - Box plot of Sepal Width by Species

**🔹 Results & Insights:**  
- Petal features clearly separate the Setosa species from others  
- Box plots showed spread and outliers in Sepal Width  
- Helped build understanding of basic EDA and plotting tools in Python

### 💳 Task 2: Credit Risk Prediction

**🔹 Objective:**  
Predict whether a loan applicant will be approved or rejected (Loan_Status) using their personal and financial details.

**🔹 My Approach:**  
- Loaded the Loan Prediction Dataset from Kaggle
- Filled missing values using median/mode
- Encoded categorical columns using Label Encoding
- Visualized loan status distribution by education and income
- Trained two models: Logistic Regression and Decision Tree
- Evaluated both using accuracy and confusion matrix

**🔹 Results & Insights:**  
- Logistic Regression performed slightly better in most cases  
- Credit history, income, and education significantly impact loan approval  
- Learned how to handle missing data, categorical encoding, and classification

### 💼 Task 4: Predicting Insurance Charges

**🔹 Objective:**  
Predict insurance charges using personal data such as age, BMI, smoking status, and more using Linear Regression.

**🔹 My Approach:**  
- Loaded and explored the Medical Cost Personal Dataset
- Applied One-Hot Encoding to categorical features
- Visualized impact of age, BMI, and smoking on charges
- Trained a Linear Regression model
- Evaluated using MAE and RMSE

**🔹 Results & Insights:**  
- Smoking status and BMI were the strongest predictors of higher charges  
- RMSE showed reasonable performance for a linear model  
- Visualizations made relationships easy to understand  
- Great hands-on experience with regression modeling and evaluation
